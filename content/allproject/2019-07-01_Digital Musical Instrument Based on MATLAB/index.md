### The combination of music and DSP

In this project, we wanted to synthesized different instrument sounds (piano, guitar, bass, violin, and drum). By analyzing physical sound mechanisms of the instrument, we remake these sounds in MATLAB and wrote digital reverbs, equalizers to modify sound effects as well.

Finally, we used FL Studio to compose digital synthesized sounds into tracks and adjusted them in real time using MATLAB.
