## **QPSK-based Image Transmission System**

In this project we designed a image transmission system based on QPSK modulation. We used MATLAB & Simulation to realize long-distance real-time image transmission, and used FM to communicate with interphone. The system structure is as follows:

Transmit structure:

Receive structure:

The final result is as follows, and the bit error rate less than 0.0003 when receiver’s SNR is 10dB.
